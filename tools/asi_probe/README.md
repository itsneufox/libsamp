# SA-MP ASI Probe

`samp_probe.asi` is an in-process analysis helper for the original or rebuilt `samp.dll`.

It is intended for local reverse-engineering and compatibility work:

1. wait for `samp.dll` to load,
2. dump its PE identity, sections, imports, and IAT targets,
3. hook selected `samp.dll` IAT entries,
4. log module-attributed Winsock/loader/patch calls,
5. optionally patch selected `WSOCK32.dll` exports inline,
6. optionally patch known `samp.dll` network RVAs for plaintext RakNet payloads,
7. optionally patch selected GTA-SA asset-loading functions for original-DLL
   object loading traces,
8. watch known GTA-SA memory locations that SA-MP commonly patches,
9. emit decoded `state:` snapshots for the loading-to-session transition,
10. optionally trace the seven original-R5 Actor RPC handlers after RakNet
    decryption and before/after original handler execution,
11. optionally correlate those RPCs through ActorPool/CActor into bounded
    CPed snapshots, direct GTA calls, and actor-scoped SCM opcode dispatches.
12. optionally trace RPC 43/112/113/116/117 through the original R5 remove-
    entity, crime-scanner, attached-object, and editor-begin helpers.
13. optionally trace original-R5 outgoing ServerCommand/DialogResponse/
    MenuSelect/MenuQuit RPCs at RakClientInterface vtable slot 26, including
    payload, transport parameters, original callsite, and send result.
14. on the validated GTA-SA 1.0 US IPL null-entity fault at `0x00405E15`,
    passively log the bounded `CFileLoader::LoadObjectInstance` input line from
    the still-live cdecl argument at `ESP[0]`.

The first pass rewrites selected import slots inside `samp.dll`, so observed calls are attributable to `samp.dll` rather than process-global Wine/WinDbg noise.

If the target bypasses its visible IAT, the probe also installs process-wide inline hooks on selected `WSOCK32.dll` exports. These hooks log only when the return address is inside the loaded `samp.dll` image, and each line includes `caller_rva`. `send`, `sendto`, successful `recv`, and successful `recvfrom` lines include a first-256-byte payload hex preview. Set `SAMP_PROBE_LOG_ALL_API=1` only when intentionally debugging process-wide noise.

For the currently observed packed prefix DLL, the probe keeps guarded internal hook candidates for:

- `samp.SocketLayer.SendTo` at RVA `0x0004ffc0`, before the SA-MP client datagram transform.
- `samp.ProcessNetworkPacket` at RVA `0x0003b950`, after `recvfrom` and before RakNet packet handling.

`PROBE_TRACE` from the R5 golden run on 2026-06-05 shows these RVAs are stale for the tested original DLL, so internal `samp.dll` code hooks are disabled by default. Enable them only for a targeted verification run with `SAMP_PROBE_ENABLE_SAMP_CODE_HOOKS=1` or `samp_probe_samp_code_hooks.flag`. The normal socket trace now labels observed R5 Winsock callsites such as `samp.dll+0x00053b19` and `samp.dll+0x00053a57` without patching those callsites.

The hook matcher supports both named imports and selected `WSOCK32.dll` ordinals. This matters for packed/protected SA-MP DLLs that expose only sparse ordinal imports such as `WSOCK32 ordinal 17` (`recvfrom`).

## Goals And Non-Goals

The probe is meant to answer concrete compatibility questions:

- Which original-DLL callsites touch the network, loader, file, and patching
  APIs?
- Which GTA-SA state changes happen during load, connect, spawn, dialog,
  TextDraw, vehicle, object, and shutdown scenarios?
- Which runtime calls are unique to `samp.dll` and which are process-global
  loader/Wine noise?
- Does the rebuilt DLL produce the same high-level sequence under the same
  scenario?

The probe is not a gameplay feature, not a public-server tool, and not a
replacement for protocol bounds checks inside the rebuilt client. Keep it for
local original-vs-rebuild comparisons.

## Build

On a host with MinGW:

```bash
tools/asi_probe/build_win32.sh
```

Through the reverse-engineering toolbox:

```bash
toolboxes/reverse-engineering/run.sh \
  bash -lc 'cd /path/to/libsamp && tools/asi_probe/build_win32.sh'
```

Debug build through the `devbuild` toolbox, with DWARF debug sections and a linker map:

```bash
toolbox run -c devbuild bash -lc 'cd /path/to/libsamp && \
  SAMP_PROBE_BUILD_DIR=build-asi-probe-debug \
  SAMP_PROBE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  SAMP_PROBE_STRIP=0 \
  tools/asi_probe/build_win32.sh'
```

Output:

```text
build-asi-probe/samp_probe.asi
```

Debug output:

```text
build-asi-probe-debug/samp_probe.asi
build-asi-probe-debug/samp_probe.map
```

## Use

Copy `samp_probe.asi` next to `gta_sa.exe` in a setup that already has an ASI loader. Run the original client or the rebuild through the same scenario.

Default log output:

```text
samp_probe.log
```

The log is written next to the ASI file when that path can be resolved.

Recommended scenario names:

```text
load_init
connect_handshake
spawn
chat_dialog_textdraw
vehicle_state
remote_player_state
object_state
disconnect
```

For a golden trace, keep the run short and deterministic:

1. clear the previous `samp_probe.log`,
2. start the original DLL or rebuilt DLL with the same server and nickname,
3. perform exactly one scenario,
4. stop the client cleanly,
5. normalize pointers, module bases, timestamps, and random values before
   comparing runs.

## Kill Switches

Create this file next to the ASI to disable IAT patching while keeping passive PE/import/watch dumps:

```text
samp_probe_no_hooks.flag
```

Environment variables are also supported:

```text
SAMP_PROBE_NO_HOOKS=1
SAMP_PROBE_NO_INLINE_HOOKS=1
SAMP_PROBE_NO_SAMP_CODE_HOOKS=1
SAMP_PROBE_ENABLE_SAMP_CODE_HOOKS=1
SAMP_PROBE_NO_WATCH=1
SAMP_PROBE_NO_STATE=1
SAMP_PROBE_STATE_ALWAYS=1
SAMP_PROBE_LOG_ALL_API=1
SAMP_PROBE_ASSET_PATHS=1
SAMP_PROBE_FILE_HOOKS=1
SAMP_PROBE_GTA_ASSET_HOOKS=1
SAMP_PROBE_OBJECT_INFO=1
SAMP_PROBE_CUSTOM_OBJECT_HEAVY=1
SAMP_PROBE_TEXTDRAW_HOOKS=1
SAMP_PROBE_TEXTDRAW_VERBOSE=1
SAMP_PROBE_TEXTDRAW_RENDER=1
SAMP_PROBE_FONT5_HOOKS=1
SAMP_PROBE_ACTOR_HOOKS=1
SAMP_PROBE_ACTOR_HEAVY=1
SAMP_PROBE_RPC_GAP_HOOKS=1
```

The asset trace can also be toggled through files next to the ASI:

```text
samp_probe_asset_paths.flag
samp_probe_file_hooks.flag
samp_probe_samp_code_hooks.flag
samp_probe_gta_asset_hooks.flag
samp_probe_object_info.flag
samp_probe_custom_object_heavy.flag
samp_probe_textdraw_hooks.flag
samp_probe_textdraw_verbose.flag
samp_probe_textdraw_render.flag
samp_probe_font5_hooks.flag
samp_probe_actor_hooks.flag
samp_probe_actor_heavy.flag
samp_probe_rpc_gap_hooks.flag
samp_probe_dialog_menu_rpc_hooks.flag
```

Use `samp_probe_asset_paths.flag` for normal original-DLL golden traces. It logs interesting SA-MP asset opens, size queries, seeks, and closes. `samp_probe_file_hooks.flag` additionally hooks `ReadFile`; keep that for short, targeted runs only because original 0.3.7 performs large overlapped reads against the SAMP archives.

Use `samp_probe_gta_asset_hooks.flag` only for short custom-object traces. It
patches GTA-SA engine asset paths observed through gta-reversed symbols:
`CStreaming::AddImageToList`, `CStreaming::LoadCdDirectory`,
`CModelInfo::AddAtomicModel`, `CModelInfo::AddTimeModel`,
`CModelInfo::AddClumpModel`, `CColStore::AddColSlot`, and
`CColStore::LoadCol`. It also traces `CPhysical::Add` at GTA-SA `0x00544A30`
for short object-flood runs; these lines include the entity model id, model
info pointer, RW object pointer, and current model store counts. Log lines
include `caller_samp_rva` when the caller is inside `samp.dll`, so a run with
the original 0.3.7 DLL can be used as `PROBE_TRACE` evidence for the original
custom-object loading path.

Add `samp_probe_object_info.flag` for focused custom-object runs. This emits
`gta_object_info` snapshots for tracked SA-MP object IDs and for custom model
IDs `11682..11753` and `18631..19999` after `AddModel`, `LoadCdDirectory`,
`CColStore::LoadCol`, and first `CPhysical::Add` observation. Each snapshot includes the GTA
`CModelInfo` pointer, selected inferred fields, and bounded raw hex dumps of
the model-info and collision-model memory. Treat those field names as
`GTA_REVERSED_REF`/`TODO_VERIFY`; the raw bytes are the durable `PROBE_TRACE`
evidence.

Use `samp_probe_custom_object_heavy.flag` for short original-DLL custom-object
registration runs. It enables asset-path, GTA-asset, and object-info hooks
without enabling full `ReadFile` tracing. In addition to the normal `gta_asset`
and `gta_object_info` lines, it emits `custom_object_heavy` lines with
stack-scanned `samp.dll` RVAs, model-info slot addresses and before/after
pointers, store counters, image and collision load state, and `CPhysical::Add`
observations for the low SAMP range `11682..11753` and high custom range
`18631..19999`.

Use `samp_probe_textdraw_hooks.flag` for focused TextDraw runs. It hooks the
known GTA `CFont` calls and logs font style, alignment, box, color, and printed
strings with SA-MP caller RVAs where available. Add
`samp_probe_textdraw_verbose.flag` only when the short run needs dense CFont
state transitions.

Add `samp_probe_textdraw_render.flag` for Font 4 sprite and Font 5 model-preview
runs. This enables the CFont hooks and then traces SA-MP's D3DX/D3D render path
by hooking `D3DXCreateSprite`, selected D3DX texture creation imports,
`ID3DXSprite::Begin/Draw/End`, and selected `IDirect3DDevice9` vtable entries
such as `SetTexture`, `SetRenderState`, `SetFVF`, and `DrawPrimitive*`. The
render probe tracks texture sources and marks short render windows after
Font 4/5 CFont hints, so lines with the prefix `textdraw_render:` are the main
diff target. Treat these as `PROBE_TRACE`/`TODO_VERIFY` evidence and keep runs
short because this flag patches COM vtables.

For the focused original-R5 Font 5 run, use only
`samp_probe_font5_hooks.flag` in addition to the normal passive probe flags.
This dedicated flag implies the TextDraw render hooks and additionally patches
two strictly validated original-`samp.dll` functions:

- `samp.dll+0x000b34a0`: style-5 preview entity preparation/cache;
- `samp.dll+0x000b3480`: cached-preview versus normal-CFont draw dispatch.

`STATIC_037`: both RVAs are for original `samp.dll`
SHA256=`b72b5dbe725f81864ca3f78bc7063bda56cc05fc7188af822fa7a754432553a2`.
The probe requires the matching PE timestamp, entry RVA, image size, and exact
function prologues before installing either hook. Other DLL identities are
logged as `unsupported_identity` and remain unmodified.

For a focused original-R5 Actor run, enable `samp_probe_actor_hooks.flag` by
itself. It does not enable the stale generic `samp.dll` network hooks. The
Actor hook set is installed atomically and traces the plaintext payload plus a
bounded semantic decode for:

- `samp.dll+0x0000eab0`: RPC 171 `ShowActor`;
- `samp.dll+0x00011e00`: RPC 172 `HideActor`;
- `samp.dll+0x0001d750`: RPC 173 `ApplyActorAnimation`;
- `samp.dll+0x0001d930`: RPC 174 `ClearActorAnimations`;
- `samp.dll+0x0001d9f0`: RPC 175 `SetActorFacingAngle`;
- `samp.dll+0x0001dad0`: RPC 176 `SetActorPos`;
- `samp.dll+0x0001dbe0`: RPC 178 `SetActorHealth`.

`STATIC_037`: these registrations and handlers were recovered from the local
original DLL with
SHA256=`b72b5dbe725f81864ca3f78bc7063bda56cc05fc7188af822fa7a754432553a2`.
The probe requires that exact PE identity proxy, exact complete-instruction
prologues, and decoded overwrite lengths for all seven handlers before it
patches the first one. Six prologues contain PE-relocated SEH metadata
immediates; their opcodes and referenced RVAs are validated against the active
module base instead of comparing preferred-base absolute bytes. Each
successful call emits matching
`actor_rpc: phase=begin` and `phase=end` lines.

RPC175 begin records include the raw IEEE-754 `angle_bits`. After the original
handler returns, the normal Actor profile follows the bounded
ActorPool -> CActor -> CPed chain and emits `actor_rpc175_readback` with the raw
`CPed+0x55c` heading bits. It also derives the expected R5 degrees-to-radians
result from the statically recovered helper at `samp.dll+0x000b5970`, reports
the numeric delta and exact converted-bit match, and records an explicit
active/null/readability/no-op reason. This read-only observation does not
require the heavy Actor hook set.

RPC176 begin records include all three raw IEEE-754 `position_bits`, whether
the first 112 payload bits are complete, and the number of ignored trailing
bits. The normal Actor profile independently resolves the ActorPool chain
before and after the one original handler call and emits
`actor_rpc176_state`/`actor_rpc176_compare`. These records distinguish the
`CActor+0x40` entity used by `CActor::SetPosition` from the cached
`CActor+0x48` CPed, preserve the `CActor+0x44` GTA handle used by the
449/537/538 train-SCM branch, report the base-`CPlaceable` vtable guard,
model, position-vfunc, train-SCM/matrix/direct-position paths and exact
position-bit matches, and capture move/turn speed, `CPed+0x46c`,
`CPhysical+0xdc`, intelligence, `CPed+0x598`, aiming rotation, and the matrix
basis. Every guard or partial read has an explicit reason. `STATIC_037` ties
this observation to RPC176 at `samp.dll+0x0001dad0`,
`CActor::SetPosition` at `samp.dll+0x0009f040`, and the normal-model
`CPed::Teleport` path at `gta_sa.exe+0x001e4110`. The focused state readback is
read-only and does not require heavy Actor hooks.

RPC178 begin records include the raw IEEE-754 `health_bits`. After the original
handler returns, the normal Actor profile also follows the statically recovered
ActorPool -> CActor -> CPed chain and emits `actor_rpc178_readback` with the raw
`CPed+0x540` bits, a match result, and an explicit no-op/failure reason. This is
bounded read-only observation and does not require the heavy Actor hook set.

For the full original-client Actor pipeline, use
`samp_probe_actor_heavy.flag` instead. Heavy mode implies the seven RPC hooks
and additionally installs one atomic eight-hook R5 set:

- `ActorPool::New/Delete` at `samp.dll+0x1900/+0x16f0`;
- `CActor::ApplyAnimation`, `ClearAnimations`, `SetFacingAngle`, `SetHealth`,
  `SetInvulnerable`, and `SetPosition` at their byte-validated R5 RVAs.

Each stage emits `actor_heavy_slot`, `actor_heavy_object`, and
`actor_heavy_ped` before/after records. These contain the exact five
per-Actor pool entries, the complete bounded 0x56-byte CActor allocation, and
selected CPed/matrix windows including model, health, armour, aiming rotation,
task intelligence, position, vtable, and the position vfunc target.

Heavy mode also byte-validates the local GTA executable
SHA256=`a559aa772fd136379155efa71f00c47aad34bbfeae6196b0fe1047d0645cbd26`
before tracing `CPed::Teleport @ 0x5e4110`,
`CPedIntelligence::FlushImmediately @ 0x601640`, and
`CRunningScript::ProcessOneCommand @ 0x469eb0`. The hot script dispatcher is
logged only while the RPC176 handler owns the current thread, a typed
`CActor::SetPosition` method is active, and its caller is the proven SA-MP
bridge return site `samp.dll+0xb22ee`. The SetPosition, Teleport, Flush, and
SCM deep records are likewise limited to the active RPC176 scope; unrelated
lifecycle SetPosition calls pass through the validated trampolines without
snapshot or logging work. Actor-related dynamic SCM records appear as
`actor_heavy_scm` with the raw opcode, decoded name, instruction pointer,
compare flag, and enclosing RPC/method sequence.

Heavy mode is intentionally process-bound and noisy. Use it for one short
`/rpcactors` cycle, exit the process cleanly, and discard any run that lacks
all three `set_preflight_ok` markers or contains `incomplete_*`/`exception:`.
Do not combine either Actor profile with another ASI that patches the same
RPC handler entries. Heavy mode additionally owns the byte-validated
`CActor::SetPosition`, `CPed::Teleport`, Flush, and script-dispatch entries;
use a passive probe profile when an overlay owns any of those targets.

For the focused RPC-gap run, enable `samp_probe_rpc_gap_hooks.flag` by itself.
This atomically preflights and installs eleven original-R5 hooks:

- RPC handlers 43, 112, 113, 116, and 117;
- RemoveBuilding entity mutators at `samp.dll+0x9cff0/+0x9d020`;
- crime-scanner helper at `samp.dll+0xa1790`;
- player attachment helper at `samp.dll+0xb0b10`;
- object/attached editor begin methods at `samp.dll+0x72420/+0x724e0`.

The hook set requires original `samp.dll`
SHA256=`b72b5dbe725f81864ca3f78bc7063bda56cc05fc7188af822fa7a754432553a2`,
its matching PE identity proxy, complete-instruction prologues, and all eleven
targets to pass before any target is modified. Records use the prefixes
`rpc_gap`, `rpc_gap_remove`, `rpc_gap_crime`, `rpc_gap_attached`, and
`rpc_gap_editor`. The remove records contain entity flag/Z values before and
after the original mutator; attachment records contain the complete 52-byte
input/stored slot and created object pointer; editor records contain the R5
mode/active/target state before and after GUI setup. Audible scanner output and
the visible 3D editor controls remain manual `OBSERVED_037` checks.

Run this mode process-bound and short. A valid trace starts with
`rpc_gap_hook: set_preflight_ok hooks=11` and
`rpc_gap_hook: summary installed=11 requested=11`. Discard the run on
`set_preflight_failed`, `incomplete_install`, or `exception:`.

For a focused original-R5 dialog/menu run, enable only
`samp_probe_dialog_menu_rpc_hooks.flag`. After NetGame creates its RakClient,
the probe validates the exact R5 PE identity, reads the RakClient pointer from
the first NetGame member, validates vtable slot 26 and requires its target to
be inside `samp.dll` before patching it. Records use `dialog_menu_rpc_hook` for
installation and `dialog_menu_rpc` for outgoing RPC 50, 62, 132, and 140. RPC
50 records decode the command string, RPC 62 records decode dialog ID,
response, list item, and input length, and RPC 132 records the selected row.
All four include bits, raw payload, priority, reliability,
ordering channel, shift-timestamp flag, SA-MP caller RVA, and the original
RakNet call result. Run it process-bound and do not hot-unload the ASI.

Run this focused probe process-bound: do not hot-unload the ASI. End the
`gta_sa.exe` process after the short capture so its code and COM-vtable hooks
cannot outlive the probe module. A valid capture must contain
`font5_code_hook: pair_preflight_ok` and a summary with `installed=2`; discard
the run if `pair_preflight_failed` or `incomplete_install` appears.

The focused trace emits `font5_dispatch:` records containing the model, slot,
cached preview pointer, position/size, rotation, zoom, vehicle colors, bounded
raw state, and SA-MP stack RVAs. During each hooked draw it correlates
`textdraw_rtt:` records through `font5_seq`, including `CreateTexture`,
texture-to-surface mapping, render-target/depth-stencil switches, viewport,
clear, stretch/resolve, and resource creation. This is still
`STATIC_037`/`PROBE_TRACE`/`TODO_VERIFY`: only the next original run can promote
the observed branch and API sequence to runtime evidence.

## Example Log Output

The exact format can evolve, but stable lines should remain module-attributed
and include RVAs where possible.

## First Questions This Should Answer

1. Does the original `samp.dll` call Winsock through its own `WSOCK32.dll` IAT as expected?
2. If not, which `WSOCK32.dll` export is called through a dynamic/unpacked function pointer?
3. Which exact callsite RVA triggers `socket`, `connect`, `sendto`, `recvfrom`, or `select`?
4. Which exact imported calls happen before the first `Connecting to ...` UI banner?
5. Which GTA-SA code/data addresses change when SA-MP installs runtime hooks?
6. Does our rebuilt DLL produce the same module-attributed call sequence under the same scenario?
7. Are current Wine trace PASS rows real `samp.dll` calls or process-global side effects?
8. At the exact point where GTA leaves the loading screen, do `ENTRY`, menu flags, HUD, D3D pointers, and the graphics/game-loop hook targets match the original client?
