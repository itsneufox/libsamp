# SA-MP Custom Asset Pipeline

> **2026-07-28 correction:** later R5 static analysis proves that the original
> DLL reserves 20,000 `CAtomicModelInfo` entries; 15,417 is the observed

## Current Evidence

- `OBSERVED_037 + PROBE_TRACE`: original 0.3.7-R5 opens `SAMP\samp.IDE`, `SAMP\custom.IDE`, `SAMP\CUSTOM.IMG`, `SAMP\SAMP.IMG`, and `SAMP\SAMPCOL.IMG`.
- `OBSERVED_037 + PROBE_TRACE`: original 0.3.7-R5 run 2026-06-11 with GTA asset hooks registered images in this order:
  `SAMP\CUSTOM.IMG` -> image id `0`, `SAMP\SAMP.IMG` -> `1`, `MODELS\GTA3.IMG` -> `2`,
  `MODELS\GTA_INT.IMG` -> `3`, `SAMP\SAMPCOL.IMG` -> `4`, then script/cutscene/player archives.
  `LoadCdDirectory` used the same order, and model stores were already populated before the first directory load
  (`atomic=15417`, `time=160`, `clump=71`). The original therefore treats image id `0` as valid and prepares SA-MP
  model slots during early GTA init, not as a late per-object fallback.
- `OBSERVED_037 + PROBE_TRACE`: the same original run drove `CModelInfo::AddAtomicModel` 1417 times after
  `store_before >= 14000`, reaching `store_after=15417`, with no new exception in that run block. This is past
  gta-reversed's vanilla `NUM_ATOMIC_MODEL_INFOS = 14000`, but it is directly observed 0.3.7 behavior for SA-MP
  custom object assets.
- `OBSERVED_037 + PROBE_TRACE`: the 2026-07-09 heavy original-prefix probe showed the low SA-MP custom range
  `11682..11753` backed by valid `ms_modelInfoPtrs` before archive directory loading. The slots used
  `0x00A9B0C8 + model * 4` (for example model `11683` at `0x00AA6754`), and the returned AtomicModelInfo pointers
  were contiguous with `0x20` stride. `LoadCdDirectory(SAMP\CUSTOM.IMG)` did not increase the model store counters,
  so this registration happens before archive directory loading. Model `11753` was the last original atomic-store
  allocation, moving the count from `15416` to `15417`.
- `OBSERVED_037 + PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF`: the original `CPhysical::Add` hook saw custom object models such
  as `19894` from `samp.dll+0x0009fd52` with non-null `model_info_ptr`; the latest original run had no
  `model_info_ptr=00000000` samples in that hook. Custom objects must therefore not reach the physical-world path
  before their model info exists.
- `PROBE_TRACE`: `SAMPCOL.IMG` uses large overlapped reads. Full `ReadFile` tracing must remain opt-in.
- `STATIC_037 + PROBE_TRACE`: original imports D3DX mesh/texture helpers including `D3DXLoadMeshFromXA` and texture creation helpers.
- `GTA_REVERSED_REF + INFERRED`: GTA object creation through script opcode `0107` assumes a valid `CModelInfo` entry. Our runtime currently skips SA-MP custom IDs because those entries are absent.
- `PROBE_TRACE + INFERRED`: replacement runs repeatedly encounter a broad set of SA-MP custom IDs from the server. The former canary whitelist has been removed so every indexed custom ID can reach the asset-readiness/registration gate.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-06-10 22:15 replacement run received the Area51 `ScrCreateObject` RPCs correctly, then crashed after `samp_asset_registration: proceed model=18631`. That points at the native custom-asset registration path, not the network decode.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-06-10 22:51 replacement run progressed through connect,
  class/spawn, `mp_session_bridge: spawn_finalize`, and script processing, then crashed immediately after targeted
  `samp_asset_registration: proceed model=19313`. The fault was a write access violation during the experimental
  ModelInfo metadata fill, so those layout writes are now guarded by writable-memory checks and can be disabled with
  `SAMPDLL_CUSTOM_ASSET_METADATA=0`.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-06-10 23:04 replacement run registered models `19313`,
  `19909`, and `19907`, then faulted at `0x004C675A` inside `CModelInfo::AddClumpModel` while processing the next
  pending custom model. The returned slots were clump-store indices 89, 90, and 91; gta-reversed documents
  `NUM_CLUMP_MODEL_INFOS = 92`. That crash is now explained as a bad local registration choice: SA-MP `objs`
  entries should follow GTA's regular object path, not the clump-object path.
- `GTA_REVERSED_REF + PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: gta-reversed `CFileLoader::LoadObject` parses normal IDE `objs`
  entries and creates `CModelInfo::AddAtomicModel` entries at `0x4C6620`; `CModelInfo::AddClumpModel` at
  `0x4C6740` belongs to the separate clump object loader. The replacement now chooses the ModelInfo add function
  from the parsed IDE section, so current SA-MP `objs` samples such as `19312`, `19313`, `19905`, `19907`, and
  `19909` no longer consume the 92-entry vanilla clump store.
- `GTA_REVERSED_REF + PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: `CBaseModelInfo` is a C++ object, so runtime offset 0 is its vtable.
  The metadata fill now writes `m_nKey` at offset 4 and `m_nTxdIndex` at offset 10; writing the key at offset 0
  corrupts the vtable.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-06-11 10:44 replacement run reached object creation for
  Area51 model `19905`, then faulted at `gta_sa.exe+0x19F8B4` (`CObject::Init`) while reading
  `CBaseModelInfo::m_pColModel + 0x29`. gta-reversed places `m_pColModel` at offset 20, so custom objects must not
  enter GTA's `CreateObject` path until their collision model is bound.
- `OBSERVED_037 + PROBE_TRACE`: local `SAMP\SAMPCOL.IMG` is a `VER2` archive with one entry,
  `AllSAMPCOLs.col`. Per-model `modelname.col` lookup is therefore a bad diagnostic assumption for SA-MP objects;
  collision loading needs to feed that aggregate COL buffer through GTA's `CColStore`/`CFileLoader` path.
- `PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: offline inspection of the local `SAMP` sidecars on 2026-07-10 found
  `SAMP.img` with 1673 entries (`1462` DFF, `208` TXD, `3` IFP), `SAMPCOL.img` with one aggregate
  `AllSAMPCOLs.col`, and `SAMP.ide` with `1433` `objs`/Atomic rows: `72` in `11682..11753` plus `1361`
  sparse rows in `18631..19999`; `CUSTOM.ide` is empty. Two additional `anim` rows, `19901` and `19902`,
  are clump models and are not part of the 1433-entry Atomic pass. The replacement now indexes those `anim` rows,
  but excludes them from the opt-in full-bulk-first eligibility count so the default 1433-entry Atomic/Time pass
  remains complete. Their animated-clump/IFP conversion remains a separate `TODO_VERIFY`. The low range has no
  missing DFF or COL names, but `46/72` rows
  reference TXDs that are not in `SAMP.img` because they are vanilla GTA TXDs such as `csmafcouch`, `int_casinoint3`,
  and `a51_ext`. Replacement diagnostics must therefore treat `txd_file=missing` separately from an actually
  unavailable `CTxdStore` slot.
- `PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-07-09 libsamp scan run registered the first nine pending Area51/tube
  models and bound their COLs, then successfully registered/created/destroyed scan model `11682`. The crash occurred
  on model `11683` during the second late `LoadCdDirectory(SAMP\SAMP.IMG)` reload, not while reading the asset files.
  This supports pre-registering the observed low range before one directory load instead of reloading `SAMP.img` once
  per scanned low-range object.
- `PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-07-10 libsamp run with early low-range synthetic registration crashed during
  spawn-finalize after registering `19905` and `18809`, immediately before the pending low model `11692` would enter
  the synthetic path (`ip=0xffff0000`). At that stage low-range bulk fill stayed opt-in and requested low IDs used
  native `AddAtomicModel`; the later relocated-store implementation supersedes that historical restriction.
- `PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: the later 2026-07-10 libsamp run with native low-ID registration reached class
  selection, spawn-finalize, registered and COL-bound the nine pending Area51/tube models, created all 19 startup
  objects, then `/sampobjscan 11682 5000 3000` successfully created and destroyed the first scan object. It crashed on
  the second scan object, model `11683`, during the second late `LoadCdDirectory(SAMP\SAMP.IMG)` replay. Late directory
  replays therefore default to one pass; later registrations still retry direct `AllSAMPCOLs.col` binding.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + INFERRED + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-07-10 13:06 replacement build applied the
  relocated atomic store with `capacity=15417`, `constructed=15417`, and `patched=35/35`. The scan then registered
  and created models `11682..11688`; all seven ModelInfos existed before the single targeted `SAMP.IMG` replay.
  Model `11689` was registered afterward at atomic-store index/count `14000`, followed by successful native additions
  through count `14006`, but its directory replay logged `archive_dir_reload_skip ... reloads=1 max=1`. The final
  marker was `object: create_begin` for `11689`, before `RequestModel`, `LoadAllRequestedModels`, and opcode `0107`.
  This exonerates `AddAtomicModel` at the vanilla boundary and points instead to a missing DFF `CStreamingInfo`
  directory mapping for models registered after the last replay.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-07-10 14:14:46 replacement build pre-registered the complete
  low range `11682..11753` before one targeted `SAMP.IMG` replay. All 72 scan models reached loaded DFF state and
  completed opcode `0107`; the former stop at `11689` succeeded with a non-null RW object. The next indexed Atomic
  model is `18631` because `11754..18630` has no stock `objs` rows. Models `18631..18635`, registered only after the
  last directory pass, retained DFF `img=0, cd_size=0` and were safely deferred by `streaming_dff_unmapped` instead
  of entering GTA creation. The run ended cleanly through `/q` and `process_detach`.

## External Loader Findings

- `GTA_REVERSED_REF`: GTA SA 1.0 US exposes the native path we need:
  - `CStreaming::AddImageToList` at `0x407610` registers image file names in `ms_files`.
  - `CStreaming::LoadCdDirectory(const char*, StreamingImgID)` at `0x5B6170` reads `VER2` IMG directories, registers DFF entries by model name, creates TXD slots with `CTxdStore::FindTxdSlot` / `CTxdStore::AddTxdSlot`, and creates COL slots through `CColStore`.
  - `CModelInfo::GetModelInfo(const char*, int32*)` at `0x4C5940` resolves DFF names to existing model IDs.
  - `CModelInfo::AddAtomicModel` at `0x4C6620` is the matching path for regular IDE `objs` entries.
  - `CModelInfo::AddTimeModel` at `0x4C66B0` is the matching path for IDE `tobj` entries.
  - `CModelInfo::AddClumpModel` at `0x4C6740` is the matching path for explicit clump object entries.
  - `CStreaming::RequestSpecialModel` at `0x409D10` loads a DFF from `ms_pExtraObjectsDir`, sets the texture dictionary to the model name when a matching TXD slot exists, then calls `RequestModel`.
  - `CColStore::AddColSlot` at `0x411140` and `CColStore::LoadCol(int32, uint8*, int32)` at `0x4106D0` can load an
    in-memory COL buffer. gta-reversed shows the first-load path uses `CFileLoader::LoadCollisionFileFirstTime` and
    binds `CColModel` instances to `CModelInfo` by model ID/name.
- `GTA_REVERSED_REF`: `CStreaming::LoadCdDirectory` sends unknown DFF names into `ms_pExtraObjectsDir`. That is important for SA-MP models because the IDE stage must create `CModelInfo` entries before or around directory loading if we want regular model IDs (`>= 18631`) instead of only GTA special-model slots.
- `GTA_REVERSED_REF`: GTA's `CDirectory::DirectoryInfo` is the same 32-byte `VER2` directory shape we already index: sector offset, sector size and 24-byte filename.
- `MTA_REF` not used for this step. The GTA native path is sufficiently covered by gta-reversed and Mod Loader.
- `INFERRED`: D3D mesh helpers imported by the original SA-MP DLL are likely for UI/model preview or fallback paths, but custom world object rendering should first use GTA's streaming pipeline. Direct D3D rendering would bypass collision, draw distance, culling and entity lifetime.

## ASI / CLEO / Mod Loader Findings

- `GTA_REVERSED_REF + INFERRED`: CLEO-style object scripts ultimately rely on GTA model IDs being valid in `CModelInfo`; they are not enough for registering new archives.
- `GTA_REVERSED_REF`: SAMPFUNCS exposes a game API wrapper for `RequestSpecialModel(model, texture, channel)`, which confirms that SA-MP modding normally goes through GTA streaming rather than immediate-mode object drawing.
- `INFERRED`: plugin-sdk-based ASI examples are useful for call signatures and hooks, but the robust custom asset pattern is represented best by Mod Loader.
- `GTA_REVERSED_REF + INFERRED`: Mod Loader's standard streamer hooks GTA SA's `CStreaming::LoadCdDirectory` callsites (`0x5B6183`, `0x5B61B8`, `0x5B61E1`, `0x5B627A`, `0x5B6449`) and `CStreaming::RequestSpecialModel` callsites (`0x409F76`, `0x409FD9`) to inject custom archive directory entries into GTA's normal streaming bookkeeping.
- `INFERRED`: We should not copy Mod Loader's hook-heavy abstraction directly. For our fixed SA-MP archives, a smaller deterministic path is safer: explicitly add `SAMP.IMG`, `CUSTOM.IMG`, `SAMPCOL.IMG`, then feed their directories into GTA's own registration functions.
- `INFERRED + TODO_VERIFY`: CLEO+ `LOAD_SPECIAL_MODEL` is useful as a RenderWare/TXD reference, but it creates an
  in-memory special model from a named DFF/TXD pair rather than a normal GTA `CModelInfo`/streaming/COL entry. That may
  be a future diagnostic renderer, but it is not parity for SA-MP world objects driven through `CreateObject`.
- `PROBE_TRACE + INFERRED + TODO_VERIFY`: the replacement now has an explicit opt-in parallel-renderer staging mode,
  `SAMPDLL_CUSTOM_OBJECT_VISUAL_FALLBACK=1`. It keeps blocked custom objects as visual-only SA-MP object slots and draws
  projected markers through the existing D3D EndScene overlay. This is not DFF mesh rendering yet; it is the lifecycle
  and render-hook foundation for a CLEO+-style DFF/TXD renderer.

## Replacement State

- Vanilla GTA models can be created through the guarded object bridge.
- SA-MP custom models are gated before they reach `CStreaming::RequestModel`.
- `OBSERVED_037 + PROBE_TRACE`: stock rows from the shipped `SAMP/samp.IDE`
  are registered on demand through the validated heap path even when the
  experimental `SAMPDLL_CUSTOM_ASSET_REGISTER` switch is off. Rows supplied by
  `SAMP/custom.IDE` remain opt-in. This separation restores the 19/19 bare-server
  startup-object path without enabling arbitrary downloaded model registration.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF`: a stock `samp.IDE` TXD reference is ready
  when it resolves in GTA's `CTxdStore`, even if no matching TXD file exists in
  `SAMP.IMG`. The Area51 models use the vanilla `a51_ext` dictionary, observed
  as TXD slot `2007` before object-scene readiness.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: native Windows GTA SA 1.0 has
  eight `CStreaming::ms_files` entries and already used six when the current
  late registration pass ran. `CUSTOM.IMG` and `SAMP.IMG` occupy the final two;
  `SAMPCOL.IMG` is therefore kept out of the streaming list and loaded through
  the existing direct `AllSAMPCOLs.col` path. `AddImageToList` result zero is
  validated against the descriptor path because it also means "list full".
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: the same native Windows run
  blocked inside synchronous `CStreaming::LoadAllRequestedModels` for model
  `11692` after a successful late SAMP DFF request, while the identical archive
  completed under Wine. Custom DFF requests now remain on GTA's asynchronous
  request list and object creation waits for a later tick to observe `LOADED`
  plus a readable RW object. Vanilla GTA object models retain synchronous load.
- `INFERRED + TODO_VERIFY`: current mutige test build can proxy indexed SA-MP custom object IDs
  through GTA model `3095` when their native `CModelInfo` entry is still absent. Logs keep both
  `model` and `render_model` so object lifetime/position can be validated without pretending that
  SAMP DFF/TXD registration is solved.
- `PROBE_TRACE + INFERRED + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-06-07 replacement run cleanly reached
  `active=128` proxied/script-created objects and still had pending server objects. The object
  bridge now defaults to a very aggressive cap of `512`, while `SAMPDLL_OBJECT_ACTIVE_CAP` and
  `SAMPDLL_OBJECT_CREATE_BUDGET` can lower/raise the test envelope without rebuilding.
- Runtime now logs a preflight line for each expected archive/IDE file:
  `samp_asset_preflight: label=... present=... size=... path=...`
- Runtime builds a lazy diagnostic IDE/IMG index on first custom-object need, not in early bootstrap:
  - `samp.IDE` / `custom.IDE`: `objs` and `tobj` map `model_id -> model_name, txd_name`.
  - `SAMP.IMG` / `CUSTOM.IMG` / `SAMPCOL.IMG`: `VER2` directory entries are indexed by filename.
  - `PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: observed `VER2` directory layout is `uint32 offset_sectors`, `uint32 size_sectors`, `char name[24]`.
  - `object_exception` lines for custom models include mapping and DFF/TXD/COL presence.
  - `samp_asset_custom_gate` logs a sample plus summary for all indexed SA-MP/custom models, including DFF/TXD readiness and whether `CModelInfo` already exists.
  - Skip reasons now distinguish `samp_custom_model_asset_incomplete` and `samp_custom_model_unregistered`.
- `GTA_REVERSED_REF + PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-06-10 custom-object slice guards a
  native SA-MP asset registration path behind `SAMPDLL_CUSTOM_ASSET_REGISTER`:
  - parse the local IDE/IMG index;
  - create indexed `CModelInfo` slots only after the multiplayer scene is loaded, using `AddAtomicModel` for
    parsed `objs` rows and `AddTimeModel` for parsed `tobj` rows;
  - keep the server-requested object queue as a retry/backfill path for IDs that arrive before the bulk
    registration point;
  - fill the inferred `CBaseModelInfo` key / TXD index / draw-distance fields unless disabled with
    `SAMPDLL_CUSTOM_ASSET_METADATA=0`;
  - register `SAMP\CUSTOM.IMG`, `SAMP\SAMP.IMG`, and `SAMP\SAMPCOL.IMG` with
    `CStreaming::AddImageToList`;
  - load their directories once through `CStreaming::LoadCdDirectory` after model infos exist.
- `OBSERVED_037 + PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: after the clump-store crash was traced to using
  `AddClumpModel` for regular `objs` rows, broad indexed-model registration exposed our too-strict vanilla
  atomic-store guard. The original 2026-06-11 run shows SA-MP 0.3.7 lets GTA's early IDE loader drive the atomic
  store counter to `15417`. A replacement 2026-07-08 run successfully registered and collision-bound several
  targeted SA-MP custom batches, then skipped ready models such as `18997`, `19425`, `18842`, and `18818` solely
  because the diagnostic guard still capped the atomic store at vanilla `14000`. A later 2026-07-08 libsamp
  replacement run proved that simply lifting this cap is not safe yet: `CModelInfo::AddAtomicModel` faulted at
  `0x004c663b` as soon as the unexpanded GTA atomic store reached `14000`. The replacement now applies an
  Open-Limit-Adjuster-style fixed `CAtomicModelInfo` store relocation during the pregame patch phase: allocate a
  `0x20`-stride store, construct every slot with GTA's `CAtomicModelInfo` constructor at `0x4C5540`, patch the GTA-SA
  AtomicModels pointer sites, and read the store count from the relocated store. This follows OLA's `ForceCapacity`
  behavior more closely than copying early `0xAAE950` bytes, which crashed at `0x004C686D` when the original static
  store had not been constructed yet. Default target capacity is the observed SA-MP ceiling `15417`
  (`SAMPDLL_ATOMIC_MODEL_STORE_CAPACITY` can override for probes). The 2026-07-10 13:06 run validated construction,
  all 35 active OLA pointer sites, and native additions through count `14006`; the 14:14 run extended that validation
  through count `14064` and created all 72 low-range models. Filling the complete stock catalog to `15417` remains
  `TODO_VERIFY`.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: targeted registration now checks `ms_clumpModelInfoStore` capacity
  only before true `AddClumpModel` calls. Regular SA-MP `objs` registration uses `AddAtomicModel`, which matches
  GTA's IDE loader and avoids the 92-entry clump-store ceiling seen in the 2026-06-11 11:04 run. The bulk path also
  guards the atomic/time/clump store counters before calling GTA's `Add*Model` functions.
- `OBSERVED_037 + PROBE_TRACE + INFERRED + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-07-08 original-R5 run shows broad custom AtomicModelInfo
  creation first, then `CUSTOM.IMG`/`SAMP.IMG`/`SAMPCOL.IMG` directory loads, then COL binding. The replacement keeps
  `SAMPDLL_CUSTOM_ASSET_BULK` as an explicit opt-in and defaults `SAMPDLL_CUSTOM_ASSET_BULK_LIMIT` to the exact 1433
  stock `objs` rows when enabled. With the relocated store active, those sparse indexed rows are registered in IDE
  parse order before
  pending server IDs and before the first archive directory pass. This matches the observed `13984 + 1433 = 15417`
  Atomic count; the environment limit and targeted low-range helper remain diagnostic fallbacks.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: replacement build `Jul 10 2026 14:59:51`,
  SHA256 `9207a814c64d2af7dd4d96a3a8081c1865b4d59b017e92f6b273e025ceaaaa3b`, registered all 1433 stock Atomic rows
  with `skipped=0`, moved the store from `13984` to `15417`, loaded the three archive directories once, and bound
  collision for `1433/1433` models. The completed `18632..19999` scan produced loaded DFFs, non-null RW objects,
  and successful opcode `0107` creates without streaming failures or exceptions. Models `19279..19281`, initially
  cancelled by fast destroy RPCs before client processing, each passed the same load/create checks in a slower
  follow-up run. Together with the prior `11682..11753` pass, this validates every renderable stock Atomic row;
  `18631` is the intentional `NoModelFile` placeholder and `19901/19902` remain separate `anim`/clump work.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-07-09 libsamp run showed ready elevator custom models
  `18755`, `18756`, and `18757` with IDE, DFF, TXD, and `AllSAMPCOLs.col` present, but later object creation skipped
  them as `samp_custom_model_registration_blocked` after the earlier broad pass reached the vanilla atomic cap
  (`model_info_store_full`, count `14000`). The former pending-first/default-zero policy protected that unexpanded
  store; the relocated 15417-entry store and exact 1433-row stock pass supersede it in the normal path.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: targeted registration now attempts a one-shot direct
  `AllSAMPCOLs.col` load from `SAMP\SAMPCOL.IMG` after requested custom `CModelInfo` entries exist, and the object
  bridge defers any `CreateObject` call whose render model still has no readable `m_pColModel`.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-06-11 13:53 replacement run showed the one-shot COL load
  happened after the first five targeted custom `CModelInfo` entries, but later targeted registrations still had
  `col_model=0x00000000`. The replacement now keeps the same `AllSAMPCOLs` slot and retries the GTA
  collision load after later registration batches, logging `registered=a->b`, `col_bound=a->b`, and the selected
  loader. After the 2026-06-11 attach run left `foamhoop1`, `tube50mglass180bend`, `funboxramp1`, and
  `tube50mglass90bend1` unbound, retries now call `CFileLoader::LoadCollisionFileFirstTime` directly instead of
  re-entering `CColStore::LoadCol` on an already-loaded slot; gta-reversed shows the later slot-loaded path searches
  only inside the slot's recorded model range, while the first-time path performs the global model-name lookup.
- `GTA_REVERSED_REF + PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: targeted custom model registration now records `objs`
  draw-distance/flags from `SAMP.ide` and can reload the SA-MP IMG directories after later targeted `CModelInfo`
  batches. This keeps late-registered models from depending on a single directory parse that may have happened
  before their `CModelInfo` slot existed. Reloads are capped by `SAMPDLL_CUSTOM_ASSET_DIR_RELOADS` and default to one
  late replay after the initial archive load, because repeated `SAMP.IMG` replays crashed in the current scan probe.
- `OBSERVED_037 + PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: targeted low-range registration now defaults to one native pass over
  the complete `11682..11753` range before the single late directory replay, independent of which low model is
  requested first. `SAMPDLL_CUSTOM_LOW_PRELOAD` defaults to `72`; smaller values retain the forward-window probe
  behavior. The helper stops at the relocated AtomicModelInfo capacity and remains disabled during `spawn_finalize`;
  with full stock bulk registration enabled it should no longer be needed in the normal path.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: immediately before custom-object streaming the bridge now snapshots
  ModelInfo vtable/key/TXD/COL/draw-distance/RW-Atomic plus DFF and TXD `CStreamingInfo` flags, IMG id, CD offset/size,
  and load state. Separate begin/end markers bracket `RequestModel`, `LoadAllRequestedModels`, and opcode `0107`.
  An indexed custom DFF with no CD mapping is left pending before `RequestModel`; after the synchronous load, custom
  creation is deferred with a 250 ms backoff unless load state is `LOADED` and `m_pRwObject` is readable.
- `OPENMP_REF + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: `ScrCreateObject` RPC 44 attachment metadata is now decoded from
  the open.mp object payload shape and kept on the object slot. Vehicle/object parents are applied after GTA object
  creation through GTA script attachment opcodes and retried after object/vehicle flushes. RPC 75
  `AttachObjectToPlayer` is decoded and stored, but actual actor attachment remains deferred until the SA-MP
  player-actor mapping and original 0.3.7 behavior are verified.
- `PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: Area51 object runs should now log `samp_asset_registration: request`,
  `samp_asset_registration: drain`, `archive_add`, and `archive_dir_loaded`, then allow custom IDs
  such as `19312`, `19313`, `19905`, `19907`, and `19909` past the object bridge if
  `CModelInfo::ms_modelInfoPtrs[id] != 0`.
- `PROBE_TRACE + OBSERVED_037 + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-06-11 11:24 Area51 run still skipped model
  `11692` with `missing_model_info`. Local `SAMP\SAMP.ide` maps it to
  `A51LandBit1, a51_ext`, and `SAMP\SAMP.IMG` contains `A51LandBit1.dff`, so the custom-object gate
  must treat parsed SA-MP/custom IDE rows as multiplayer asset models even below the former
  high-ID cutoff `18631`.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-06-10 21:18 run decoded `ScrCreateObject`
  correctly, but all sampled Area51 models still skipped with `samp_custom_model_unregistered`.
  The same rows showed their DFF files present in `SAMP.IMG`, so the registration path now creates
  targeted `CModelInfo` entries from IDE metadata after the local index confirms the
  required DFF/TXD inputs; `CStreaming::LoadCdDirectory` remains responsible for binding DFF/TXD data.

## Object material pipeline

Original static reference: SA-MP 0.3.7-R5 `samp.dll`, SHA256
`b72b5dbe725f81864ca3f78bc7063bda56cc05fc7188af822fa7a754432553a2`.
The claims below tagged `STATIC_037` come from the existing Ghidra analysis plus direct disassembly of exactly
that binary; no material-specific original runtime hook has corroborated them yet.

- `STATIC_037`: RPC 44 at `samp.dll+0x1B340` dispatches its trailing material list through
  `samp.dll+0x1B070`; RPC 84 enters at `samp.dll+0x1B6A0`. Both populate the same 16 persistent
  per-object slots. Type-1 records contain source model, TXD, texture and wire-ABGR colour. Type-2 records
  contain font/text parameters and up to `0x800` bytes of RakNet-compressed text.
- `STATIC_037`: `CObject::SetMaterial` at `samp.dll+0xA8530` resolves the source texture. Positive source
  models are requested with flag `2`, polled up to 250 times with `Sleep(2)`, and released afterward only when
  they had no prior model reference and are resident. Model `-1` is colour-only. Model `0` uses the separately
  loaded `SAMP\\blanktex.txd` path through
  `samp.dll+0xB2B90`, with the cached texture pointer at `samp.dll+0x1A2600`.
- `STATIC_037`: callbacks at `samp.dll+0xA8AD0`, `+0xA8840`, and `+0xA8B50` capture, apply, and restore
  materials around every object draw (`+0xA8C00` / `+0xA9E70`). The material index restarts for every Atomic.
  The original therefore never leaves a replacement texture or colour on GTA's shared `RpGeometry`.
- `STATIC_037 + GTA_REVERSED_REF + TODO_VERIFY`: GTA `CAtomicModelInfo::CreateInstance` clones the Atomic but shares its
  Geometry. The replacement consequently patches only the validated `CObject::Render` vtable entry
  `0x866FA8` (index 18, original pointer `0x59F180`) and restores that pointer on shutdown. Immediately before
  the original render it swaps resolved slot textures/colours and the `rpGEOMETRYMODULATEMATERIALCOLOR` flag;
  immediately afterward it restores texture, colour, surface properties, and geometry flags. Runtime validation
  must still prove the hook target and restoration path in Wine.
- `PROBE_TRACE + GTA_REVERSED_REF + INFERRED + TODO_VERIFY`: the 2026-07-10 SuperFreeroam `/ls` teleport run
  completed 17 first material draws and then faulted at GTA `0x757D6E`, where the D3D9 All-In-One instancing path
  dereferenced a null stream-0 vertex buffer immediately before `IDirect3DVertexBuffer9::Lock`. Unlike R5's own
  pre/post-draw lifecycle, the replacement vtable hook can enter before a Geometry has its first `RwResEntry`.
  The replacement therefore applies a resolved texture immediately but defers material-colour/surface-property and
  Geometry-flag mutation until `geometry->repEntry` contains a readable D3D9 header with a non-null stream-0 vertex
  buffer. `object_material: render_begin` records Geometry flags, resource entry, header, serial, mesh count, both
  vertex streams, and readiness before calling GTA; `render_apply` records the post-render stream state.
- `PROBE_TRACE`: the 2026-07-10 SuperFreeroam run received 216 standalone type-1 material RPCs, but the former
  singleton `world_visual` transport exposed only 92 to the runtime. Those 92 all ended as `object_not_ready`
  (49) or `no_rw_object` (43), and all 80 inline CreateObject material lists were explicitly ignored. No material
  reached rendering. A transport snapshot or one-shot apply attempt is therefore not authoritative material state.
- `STATIC_037 + OPENMP_REF + INFERRED + TODO_VERIFY`: the replacement now keeps an authoritative, lazy material
  store in the network adapter, keyed by object ID, object generation, and material slot. Only slots actually
  received are allocated; a slot owns the complete normalized type-1/type-2 definition and its monotonically
  increasing material revision. Long text remains outside the frequently copied RPC snapshot. Destroy, generation
  replacement, disconnect, and adapter reset release the corresponding slot state. Material allocation/budget failure
  is fail-soft for object lifetime: the new Create generation still replaces the old object with an empty material
  state. The large diagnostic snapshot itself lives in static bridge storage rather than GTA's game-thread stack.
- `INFERRED + TODO_VERIFY`: ordered `SET_MATERIAL` object-ring entries are compact invalidation descriptors, not
  copies of the full material payload. They carry object ID, object generation, slot, source/type, and material
  revision. The runtime uses `samp_raknet_client_get_object_material` to fetch the latest complete definition from
  the authoritative slot, ignores duplicate/older revisions, and keeps unresolved revisions pending while the GTA
  object, RW object, source model, TXD, or texture is not resident.
- `INFERRED + TODO_VERIFY`: a Create event establishes a new generation and triggers a 16-slot authoritative
  resync after the local object slot exists; this recovers inline CreateObject materials without emitting one large
  event per material. RakPeer may dispatch more RPC handlers than the outer packet budget in one `Receive()`, so the
  compact 1024-entry ring is not authoritative. The adapter also retains the latest alive/Create state per object ID.
  If the object-event consumer detects a sequence gap/ring overwrite, it first reconciles missing Create/Destroy
  generations and then
  rescans the authoritative slots for every active or pending object generation instead of assuming the missing
  descriptors were non-material events. Generation equality prevents a late material revision from an earlier
  occupant of the same object ID from reaching the replacement object.
- `STATIC_037 + OPENMP_REF`: default material colour is ABGR on the wire and is copied as a raw DWORD into
  RenderWare's RGBA bytes. Zero means no colour override; alpha zero is not rewritten to opaque. Colour is applied
  independently of texture resolution. The transient draw path clears geometry flag `0x08`, sets `0x40`, and restores
  both afterward. Text foreground and background colours remain ARGB fields.
- `STATIC_037 + TODO_VERIFY`: type-2 definitions enter `CObject::SetMaterialText` at `samp.dll+0xA86B0` and are
  constructed lazily by `+0xA9EE0` through the text-texture manager at `+0x708B0`; `+0xA8ED0` releases generated
  textures for device loss. The replacement decodes and persists these definitions, but rendering still needs the
  original `samp.dll+0x74B50` D3D `SetTexture` substitution and a verified lost/reset-device lifecycle.
- `STATIC_037 + TODO_VERIFY`: model-zero material handling is still open. It must reproduce the dedicated cached
  `SAMP\\blanktex.txd` lifetime and must not be collapsed into either the colour-only `model < 0` case or the
  now-active positive-source-model streaming path.

Render-hook validation target: GTA SA 1.0 US `gta_sa.exe`, SHA256
`a559aa772fd136379155efa71f00c47aad34bbfeae6196b0fe1047d0645cbd26`.

## Implementation Path

1. `PROBE_TRACE`: capture path-only original run with `samp_probe_asset_paths.flag`.
2. `STATIC_037`: identify original function-entry RVAs for IDE/IMG registration, not just file API callsites.
3. `GTA_REVERSED_REF`: implement a registration-only phase:
   - add `SAMP\CUSTOM.IMG`, `SAMP\SAMP.IMG`, and `SAMP\SAMPCOL.IMG` through `CStreaming::AddImageToList`;
   - parse `samp.IDE` / `custom.IDE` and create section-appropriate `CModelInfo` slots for object IDs with no existing `CModelInfo`;
   - set model name and texture dictionary metadata from IDE (`model_name`, `txd_name`);
   - run GTA-compatible directory registration for DFF/TXD/COL entries.
4. `TODO_VERIFY`: register archive entries without rendering first; validate `CModelInfo::ms_modelInfoPtrs[id] != 0` and `CTxdStore::FindTxdSlot(txd_name) != -1` for sampled custom IDs.
5. `TODO_VERIFY`: only then allow SA-MP custom object IDs through the existing object bridge. The bridge no longer has a canary whitelist, but it remains closed until `CModelInfo::ms_modelInfoPtrs[id] != 0`.

## Concrete Next Slice

### Switchable custom-object ModelInfo/render path

`MTA_REF + PROBE_TRACE + INFERRED + TODO_VERIFY`: the replacement accepts
`SAMPDLL_CUSTOM_OBJECT_RENDER_PATH=heap` through the process environment or
`sampdll.ini`. `heap` is the default and currently the only enabled path. It
skips AtomicModelInfo-store relocation, clones a validated atomic template into
one heap allocation per indexed custom `objs` model, clears its runtime
reference, collision and RenderWare ownership, and installs the pointer directly
in `CModelInfo::ms_modelInfoPtrs`. GTA still uses its ordinary streaming,
RenderWare and script-opcode object creation; this is not a Direct3D proxy path.
Synthetic atomic entries reset template-owned 2DFX/object-info/ownership fields
to GTA's `CBaseModelInfo::Init` baseline and apply the parsed IDE flags through
GTA `SetAtomicModelInfoFlags` (`gta_sa.exe` VA `0x5B3B20`). This includes
`DRAW_LAST` for alpha-sorted custom models such as `Tube50mGlass1` (18809).

The relocated-store `native` implementation remains compiled as a diagnostic
fallback, but its runtime selection is disabled while the heap path is being
qualified. An old `native`, `store`, or `0` setting therefore selects `heap` and
is reported as `native_disabled=1` in `samp_runtime.log`. The selection is cached
and therefore requires a game restart.

For an A/B run, keep server, route and object IDs identical and compare
`object_model_state` phases `pre_request`, `post_request`, `post_load`,
`post_create`, `pre_destroy`, and `post_destroy`. The rows include actual
`model_info_path`, ModelInfo/vtable/key, TXD slot/streaming row, `pColModel`,
RenderWare object and DFF streaming state. `object_lifecycle: create_end` and
`destroy_end` additionally record the GTA object/entity lifetime. Probe model
15417 only when the loaded IDE actually indexes it; the stock SA-MP high custom
range begins at 18631, so 18631 and later observed IDs are the authoritative
stock test set.

1. `STATIC_037 + PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: keep mapping the original early-init IDE/archive function RVAs so
   the replacement can move custom model registration from late object fallback toward the original startup path.
2. `PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: with the opt-in bulk pass enabled, verify the default limit reports
   `considered=1433`, `skipped=0`, `bulk_first=1`, and IDE-order registration before the first
   `archive_dir_batch`, even though the shared index also contains the two deferred `anim` rows. The default heap
   path must leave the native Atomic count unchanged; `13984->15417` applies only to a future verified native-store
   implementation. Then rerun
   `/sampobjscan 11682 5000 3000`; after `11753`, model `18631` and later high IDs must show nonzero DFF `cd_size`,
   load state `1`, readable `rw_object`, and successful `create_opcode_end`.
3. `PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: if a stock Atomic still logs `streaming_dff_unmapped`, keep it pending and inspect
   bulk summary/order plus the first archive pass; do not raise the replay limit without new evidence.
4. `PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: with `SAMPDLL_CUSTOM_OBJECT_VISUAL_FALLBACK=1`, verify blocked custom objects log
   `object_visual_fallback: activate` and draw projected markers before adding real DFF/RenderWare loading.
5. `PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: run custom and original prefixes on the same Area51 script and diff
   object visibility plus `samp_asset_registration` / `object_exception` lines.
6. `TODO_VERIFY`: verify `CModelInfo::ms_modelInfoPtrs[id] != 0`, TXD slot, and DFF streaming state
   for sampled custom IDs after directory load.
7. `TODO_VERIFY`: implement COL registration/validation if world objects render but have missing or
   wrong collision.
8. `OPENMP_REF + PROBE_TRACE + TODO_VERIFY`: verify attached custom objects on original and replacement runs,
   especially vehicle/object parent ordering and player attachments sent through RPC 75.
9. **CLOSED / I.O.** (`STATIC_037 + OPENMP_REF + PROBE_TRACE`):
   `RemoveBuildingForPlayer` is implemented beyond decode-only, persists its
   rules and reapplies them while streaming. Exact R5 visual comparison is a
   non-blocking parity note rather than an open RPC gap.
10. `PROBE_TRACE + STATIC_037`: rerun SuperFreeroam and require matching `object-material-decode: queue` /
    authoritative-revision / `object_material: persist` totals, successful `object_material: resolved`, and at
    least one `object_material: render_apply`. Exercise both an inline-material Create resync and a forced object-ring
    gap; both must converge to the latest authoritative slot revisions without applying an older generation. Visually
    compare the glass, coloured-light, decking, wallpaper, and `cauldron1/alienliquid1` replacements seen in the prior
    RPC 84 payloads.

## Guardrails

- Do not pass a custom model to `RequestModel` until model info is present.
- Keep `SAMPCOL.IMG` reads out of the ASI trace unless explicitly enabled.
- Prefer archive/IDE registration before any Direct3D mesh fallback; the original behaves like a GTA asset integration layer, not just an immediate-mode renderer.
- Do not treat the compact material-event ring as authoritative. On Create or an event gap, recover complete slots
  from the adapter store and require an exact object-generation match.
- Do not consume a material revision merely because its GTA entity, RW object, TXD, or texture is temporarily absent;
  keep it pending and retry without permanently modifying shared `RpGeometry`.
